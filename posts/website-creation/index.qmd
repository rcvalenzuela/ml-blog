This post outlines my thoughts on how to structure this webpage

## Things to do

1. Finish the high level organization of the website (i.e. what goes where)
2. Understand how to set up a unified look and feel

## Organization

### Landing page

I decided to use the Bootstrap 5 framework. As a reference I am using:

1. [Bootstrap 5 tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap5/index.php)
2. [Get started with Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/)

## Technical stuff

### Setting up github pages

### Custom fonts
