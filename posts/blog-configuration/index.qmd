On this post I keep a record of all the steps needed to configure/publish the blog

## Publishing to github-pages

I follow the steps described in the [Publish command](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html#publish-command) section of the Github pages part of the quarto documentation.

In order to use quarto publish from the command line I create a Personal Access token using the instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token#creating-a-fine-grained-personal-access-token)

## Adding custom domain

I follow the guide [Managing a custom domain for your GitHub Pages site](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site#about-custom-domain-configuration)
